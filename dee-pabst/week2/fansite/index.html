                    <strong>Sophie Mary Wilson CBE FRS FREng DistFBCS</strong> (born Roger Wilson; June 1957) is an English computer scientist, who helped design the BBC Micro and ARM architecture.
                    She was instrumental in designing the BBC Micro, including the <em>BBC BASIC programming language</em> whose development she led for the next 15 years. She first began designing the ARM reduced instruction set computer (RISC) in 1983, which entered production two years later. It is now the most widely used processor architecture in smartphones. Wilson is currently a director at the technology conglomerate Broadcom Inc. In 2011, she was listed in Maximum PC as number 8 in an article titled "The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History". She was made a Commander of the British Empire in 2019.
